# Capstone II | CS493: WRF Model Optimization Codebase

Welcome to the repository dedicated to advancing the optimization of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, specifically focusing on the WRF-Solar model enhancements. This project is part of the CS492 course and aims at refining parameter tuning methods to improve prediction accuracy and computational efficiency in climate modeling.

## Purpose of the Repository

The focus of this repository is on optimizing key parameters of the WRF-Solar model to better simulate solar irradiance, which is crucial for accurate climate modeling and weather forecasting. Solar irradiance at the Earth's surface is determined by three primary types:

1. **Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)**: Solar radiation received directly from the sun, impacting the surface at a normal (perpendicular) angle.
2. **Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI)**: Solar radiation scattered by the atmosphere, arriving at the Earth's surface from various angles.
3. **Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)**: The total irradiance from direct sunlight and sky-diffused light on a horizontal surface, which is the sum of DNI and DHI.

### Critical Parameters in Focus:

- **`beta_con` (Beta Condensation Rate)**: Influences the microphysics associated with cloud formation, directly affecting DHI by altering the cloud coverage and density, which modulates the amount of scattered light.
- **`vdis` (Variance Dispersion)**: Controls the spread of cloud droplet sizes, impacting both DNI and DHI by determining how sunlight is diffused through clouds and aerosols.

By tuning these parameters to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the model's predictions of solar irradiance (`SWDOWN`) and actual ground truth measurements, we aim to enhance the model's reliability for climate researchers and meteorologists. The algorithms developed here apply advanced optimization techniques to find the optimal settings of `beta_con` and `vdis` that reflect realistic atmospheric conditions.

## Repository Structure
**Key Directories and Files:**

- **`SA_algo.py`**: Implements a Stochastic Approximation (SA) based method to iteratively improve parameters.

### Final Presentation

- **`Final Presentation.pdf`**: Contains a detailed presentation of the project, summarizing the background, objectives, research approach, key results, challenges, and areas for future work. This presentation provides a comprehensive recap of the project's outcomes and insights.

### Output Plots Directories

- **`BO_output_plots`**: Stores output plots generated by the Bayesian Optimization algorithm. Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific `(beta_con, vdis)` parameter combination and contains the resulting comparison plot.
  
- **`D3QN_output_plots`**: Stores output plots generated by the D3QN optimization runs. As with BO, each subdirectory represents a run with a particular `(beta_con, vdis)` and includes the performance plot.

- **`SA_output_plots`**: Contains plots from the Stochastic Approximation method, organized by parameter sets.

### Ground Truth Directory

- **`ground_truth`**: 
  - `ground_truth_data.npy`: Contains the ground truth data in NumPy binary format.
  - `ground_truth.jpg` & `ground_truth_subplot.jpg`: Visual representations of the ground truth data.
  - `sgpradflux10long_area_mean.c2.20090506_1200UTC.nc`: NetCDF file containing observational ground truth data for a specific date and time.

## Algorithms and Files Explained

### Bayesian Optimization (`BO_algo.py`)

- **Purpose**: Bayesian Optimization is used to find the best parameters `(beta_con, vdis)` for the WRF model by building a probabilistic model of the objective function (MSE). 
- **Key Steps**:
  1. **Update Namelist**: Adjusts the WRF `namelist.input` file with new `beta_con` and `vdis` values.
  2. **Run WRF Model**: Executes WRF with the updated parameters.
  3. **Process Output & Calculate MSE**: Extracts SWDOWN values from the WRF output and compares them with the ground truth data.
  4. **Optimize**: Uses Gaussian Processes (via `gp_minimize`) to iteratively propose better `(beta_con, vdis)` combinations, aiming to minimize MSE.
- **Outputs**: Saves plots and data in `BO_output_plots` for each evaluated parameter set.

### Double Deep Q-Network (`D3QN_algo.py`)

- **Purpose**: The D3QN algorithm treats parameter tuning as a reinforcement learning problem, where `(beta_con, vdis)` represent the state, and discretized adjustments to these parameters form the action space.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. **Q-Learning Setup**: Uses neural networks to approximate the Q-function, guiding policy updates.
  2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Initially explores random actions (parameter changes), then exploits learned knowledge to pick better actions.
  3. **Reward Function**: Negative of MSE is used as a reward signal, encouraging actions leading to better model performance.
  4. **Experience Replay & Target Networks**: Enhances stability and performance of the RL approach.
- **Outputs**: Saves training progression plots under `D3QN_output_plots`. Each subdirectory indicates a distinct parameter run and the resulting MSE plot.

### Stochastic Approximation (`SA_algo.py`)

- **Purpose**: SA is a simpler iterative method where parameters `(beta_con, vdis)` are updated in a gradient-based manner. Unlike Bayesian Optimization, it does not maintain a global probabilistic model, and unlike D3QN, it doesnâ€™t frame the problem as a reinforcement learning task.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. **Perturbation & Gradient Estimate**: Perturbs parameters slightly to estimate the gradient of MSE.
  2. **Parameter Updates**: Moves `(beta_con, vdis)` in the direction that reduces MSE.
  3. **Convergence Check**: Iterates until improvements in MSE plateau or a threshold is reached.
- **Outputs**: Similar to the other methods, generated plots are stored in `SA_output_plots` for each parameter configuration tested.

## Ground Truth Data Handling

- All methods rely on ground truth data stored in `ground_truth`.
- The MSE calculation involves comparing WRF output (SWDOWN) against the provided observational data (swdtot) to measure performance.
