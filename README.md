# Capstone I | CS492: Model Optimization Repository

<h3>!! Currently Updated Repository !!</h3>

This repository focuses on the optimization of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model parameters using different algorithms. The primary goal is to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the WRF model's predictions and the ground truth data. Below is an overview of the repository structure, the algorithms implemented, and the purpose of each file and directory.

## Repository Structure
**Key Directories and Files:**

- **`BO_algo.py`**: Implements Bayesian Optimization (BO) for parameter tuning.
- **`D3QN_algo.py`**: Implements a Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) reinforcement learning approach for parameter optimization.
- **`SA_algo.py`**: Implements a Stochastic Approximation (SA) based method to iteratively improve parameters.

### Output Plots Directories

- **`BO_output_plots`**: Stores output plots generated by the Bayesian Optimization algorithm. Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific `(beta_con, vdis)` parameter combination and contains the resulting comparison plot.
  
- **`D3QN_output_plots`**: Stores output plots generated by the D3QN optimization runs. As with BO, each subdirectory represents a run with a particular `(beta_con, vdis)` and includes the performance plot.

- **`SA_output_plots`**: Contains plots from the Stochastic Approximation method, organized by parameter sets.

### Ground Truth Directory

- **`ground_truth`**: 
  - `ground_truth_data.npy`: Contains the ground truth data in NumPy binary format.
  - `ground_truth.jpg` & `ground_truth_subplot.jpg`: Visual representations of the ground truth data.
  - `sgpradflux10long_area_mean.c2.20090506_1200UTC.nc`: NetCDF file containing observational ground truth data for a specific date and time.

## Algorithms and Files Explained

### Bayesian Optimization (`BO_algo.py`)

- **Purpose**: Bayesian Optimization is used to find the best parameters `(beta_con, vdis)` for the WRF model by building a probabilistic model of the objective function (MSE). 
- **Key Steps**:
  1. **Update Namelist**: Adjusts the WRF `namelist.input` file with new `beta_con` and `vdis` values.
  2. **Run WRF Model**: Executes WRF with the updated parameters.
  3. **Process Output & Calculate MSE**: Extracts SWDOWN values from the WRF output and compares them with the ground truth data.
  4. **Optimize**: Uses Gaussian Processes (via `gp_minimize`) to iteratively propose better `(beta_con, vdis)` combinations, aiming to minimize MSE.
- **Outputs**: Saves plots and data in `BO_output_plots` for each evaluated parameter set.

### Double Deep Q-Network (`D3QN_algo.py`)

- **Purpose**: The D3QN algorithm treats parameter tuning as a reinforcement learning problem, where `(beta_con, vdis)` represent the state, and discretized adjustments to these parameters form the action space.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. **Q-Learning Setup**: Uses neural networks to approximate the Q-function, guiding policy updates.
  2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Initially explores random actions (parameter changes), then exploits learned knowledge to pick better actions.
  3. **Reward Function**: Negative of MSE is used as a reward signal, encouraging actions leading to better model performance.
  4. **Experience Replay & Target Networks**: Enhances stability and performance of the RL approach.
- **Outputs**: Saves training progression plots under `D3QN_output_plots`. Each subdirectory indicates a distinct parameter run and the resulting MSE plot.

### Stochastic Approximation (`SA_algo.py`)

- **Purpose**: SA is a simpler iterative method where parameters `(beta_con, vdis)` are updated in a gradient-based manner. Unlike Bayesian Optimization, it does not maintain a global probabilistic model, and unlike D3QN, it doesnâ€™t frame the problem as a reinforcement learning task.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. **Perturbation & Gradient Estimate**: Perturbs parameters slightly to estimate the gradient of MSE.
  2. **Parameter Updates**: Moves `(beta_con, vdis)` in the direction that reduces MSE.
  3. **Convergence Check**: Iterates until improvements in MSE plateau or a threshold is reached.
- **Outputs**: Similar to the other methods, generated plots are stored in `SA_output_plots` for each parameter configuration tested.

## Ground Truth Data Handling

- All methods rely on ground truth data stored in `ground_truth`.
- The MSE calculation involves comparing WRF output (SWDOWN) against the provided observational data (swdtot) to measure performance.

## Running the Codes

- Before running any algorithm, ensure that:
  - WRF is correctly installed and compiled.
  - The `namelist.input` file path and other referenced directories are updated as per your local environment.
  - Required Python packages (`numpy`, `pandas`, `netCDF4`, `matplotlib`, `skopt`, `tensorflow` for D3QN, etc.) are installed.

- **Bayesian Optimization**: Run `python BO_algo.py`
- **D3QN**: Run `python D3QN_algo.py`
- **Stochastic Approximation**: Run `python SA_algo.py`

## Disclaimer

This repository is currently updated and maintained. Each method represents a unique approach to optimizing WRF model parameters. The code and strategies are subject to further refinements and improvements.
